# Bank Kata

## Description

The Kata is described on [Sandro Mancuso's github repo](https://github.com/sandromancuso/Bank-kata). 

Our approach is following the [9 rules](https://github.com/sandromancuso/Bank-kata#the-rules). To understand why of these rules, read the [Object Calisthenics PDF](http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/luontola/tdd-2009/ext/ObjectCalisthenics.pdf).

This is an in-progress kata.
